        	<p>Welcome to South Valley Pharmacy Services! For over 25 years, we have been servicing residential, assisted living and group homes across central and northern California. My love for pharmacy began when I was in high school as my father was a pharmacist and pharmacy owner. After high school, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in international business with a minor in German. I started a career in Silicon Valley working for a sales and marketing firm in the early 90's and lived abroad until I moved back to the United States in April 2006. With over 36 years of experience in customer service, I took over South Valley Pharmacy Services, Gilroy in May 2006.</p>

            <p>The moment I entered back into pharmacy I vowed to use my customer service experience to nurture and ignite new relations. I am happy to report that business has grown into new service areas and relations are continuing to blossom. We have more than tripled in size at the same time retaining the integrity and utmost quality of services. In August of 2019 I opened <a href="http://www.centralcoastpharmacyservices.com" target="_blank"><strong>Central Coast Pharmacy Services</strong></a> to better service Monterey County. It was an important decision as we were growing and the need to be close to our customers was critical so we could maintain the quality services that I committed to deliver. We now offer specialty medications administered at our facility as well as off site and on site clinical consulting services. Our compliance packaging is key in improving medication adherence and overall patient outcomes which can be key in alleviating hospital readmissions.</p>

            <p>Our first priority is to fully understand your long term pharmacy needs in order for us to customize and fulfill your expectations. This dynamic environment of multiple doctors, managing and communicating drug interactions and allergies requires us to remain flexible but at the same time professional and consistent. We service the needs of all patients and facilities with multiple prescription packaging, accepting all insurances including Kaiser and workman's compensation. We will become the patient/care-giver's advocate in terms of obtaining refills with the doctor (s) and prior authorizations with the insurance companies. We deliver each day with accuracy and in a timely manner to all of our facilities and offer 24/7 after hour services for emergencies.</p>

            <p>We hope you will join our pharmacy by allowing us to fulfill your pharmacy needs.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
